The first two plot reveal the number of individuals within a five hour range of measurement of \"played_hours\". Using the \"fill\" argument the plots also show the proportions of genders and experience levels of each of the five hour groups of individuals. These visualizations help understand patterns involving the frequency of different genders and experience levels within each five hour range. Upon viewing the first two plots, you could further question which gender and experience level offer the most dedicated players (players with the most highest played_hours).\n",

    "Because the outcome variable is numerical, the method I propose using is a KNN-regression model. One limitation of KNN-regression is that with large data sets it can be very slow and not practical. In this case since the predictor variables are categorical we will use \"dummy variables\" to alter the predictor variables so they can be used in the KNN-regression model. In this model I will split the data into training set (75%) and testing set (25%) and then use a 5-fold cross validation to find the neighbors with the lowest RMSPE. After finding the best value for neighbors, we will evalutate our data using the KNN model to estimate the played hours of an indiviudal of a certain gender and experience level. It would be helpful visualize the regression model with a 3D graph (since we have 2 predictor variables) displaying the plane that estimates played hours for differnt observations which could help me interpret if there is any relationship between the experience and gender with played hours. \n",

    "As we can see the results of the model show that gender and experience are not good predictors of played hours. The calculated RMSPE was found to be around 40. This RMSPE means that on average each prediction of played_hours was off by 40 hours from the real value of played_hours for each individual. The graph above gives a strong visualization of how far off the predictions are. As we can see, the x axis shows the acutal played hours for each individual and the the y axis shows the predicted played hours for the individual. If the predictions were perfect the points on the graph would take the shape of a straight line, with the equation of y=x because the predicted value of played_hours would be the same as the actual value. The red dashed line on the graph above has the equation y=x and indicates the perfect scenario in which RMSPE = 0. A large majority of the points are located off of the red which shows that gender and experience are weak predictors of played_hours."
