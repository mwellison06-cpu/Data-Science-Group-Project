    "A group of UBC students have created their own special minecraft server. The purpose of the server is to gather data about the players, and how they play the game to gain possible insights on machine learning and AI. The students have provided us with data about the individual players and logged sessions on the server. This data is in the form of two .csv (comma separated values) files - players.csv and sessions.csv. In this project we will highlight a specific question we have formulated about relationships, patterns or correlations between the data to find out specific information on the players and/or sessions. The conclusions of our projects will be provided to the owners of the server and used to assist in their study about AI and machine learning. Our topic of interest within the data sets is about predicting which “kinds” of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data. What this topic really means is which types of players had the most total played hours on the minecraft server. Based on this topic, we have formulated a specific question to determine if there is any sort of correlation between the observations of variables within the dataset and the observations of the total played hours variable. We proposed, \"Can gender, experience level, and age predict played_hours in the players.csv dataset?\", as our predictive question. Throughout the report, we will use a series of data analysis, including visualization and modeling, to help answer the predictive question.\n",

    "The players.csv dataset contains seven total variables, four of them being “played_hours”, “Age”, “gender” and “experience”. The following table has been created to summarize the 7 variables in the players.csv dataset. We must check if there are any N/A values in the observations of the players.csv dataset. This is necessary because when performing models and data visualizations in R, if there are any N/A values within the variables of interest it could possibly results in an error in the code. The following code reveals that within the \"Age\" column there are 2 N/A's. Therefore in future code we must make sure to remove these N/A's so we don't receive an error. \n",
