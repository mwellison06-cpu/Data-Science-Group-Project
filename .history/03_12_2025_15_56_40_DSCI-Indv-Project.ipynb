    "A group of UBC students have created their own special minecraft server. The purpose of the server is to gather data about the players, and how they play the game to gain possible insights on machine learning and AI. The students have provided us with data about the individual players and logged sessions on the server. This data is in the form of two .csv (comma separated values) files - players.csv and sessions.csv. In this project we will highlight a specific question we have formulated about relationships, patterns or correlations between the data to find out specific information on the players and/or sessions. The conclusions of our projects will be provided to the owners of the server and used to assist in their study about AI and machine learning. Our topic of interest within the data sets is about predicting which “kinds” of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data. What this topic really means is which types of players had the most total played hours on the minecraft server. Based on this topic, we have formulated a specific question to determine if there is any sort of correlation between the observations of variables within the dataset and the observations of the total played hours variable. We proposed, \"Can gender, experience level, and age predict played_hours in the players.csv dataset?\", as our predictive question. Throughout the report, we will use a series of data analysis, including visualization and modeling, to help answer the predictive question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The players.csv dataset contains seven total variables, four of them being “played_hours”, “Age”, “gender” and “experience”. The following table has been created to summarize the 7 variables and includes information about which each variable means (Description) and the type of data each variable is (Data Type). One key step is that we must check if there are any N/A values in the observations of the players.csv dataset. This is necessary because when performing models and data visualizations in R, if there are any N/A values within the variables of interest it could possibly results in an error in the code. The following code reveals that within the \"Age\" column there are 2 N/A's. Therefore in future code we must make sure to ignore or remove these N/A's so we don't receive an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will figure out how many observations are in our data set. The following code also does this. The players.csv contains 196 observations, meaning that 196 individuals are included in the dataset."

    "Because the outcome variable is numerical, the method I propose using is a KNN-regression model. One limitation of KNN-regression is that with large data sets it can be very slow and not practical. In this case since the predictor variables are categorical we will use \"dummy variables\" to alter the predictor variables so they can be used in the KNN-regression model. In this model I will split the data into training set (75%) and testing set (25%) and then use a 5-fold cross validation to find the neighbors with the lowest RMSPE. After finding the best value for neighbors, we will evalutate our data using the KNN model to estimate the played hours of an indiviudal of a certain gender and experience level. It would be helpful visualize the regression model with a 3D graph (since we have 2 predictor variables) displaying the plane that estimates played hours for differnt observations which could help me interpret if there is any relationship between the experience and gender with played hours. \n",

    "As we can see the results of the model show that gender and experience are not good predictors of played hours. The calculated RMSPE was found to be around 40. This RMSPE means that on average each prediction of played_hours was off by 40 hours from the real value of played_hours for each individual. The graph above gives a strong visualization of how far off the predictions are. As we can see, the x axis shows the acutal played hours for each individual and the the y axis shows the predicted played hours for the individual. If the predictions were perfect the points on the graph would take the shape of a straight line, with the equation of y=x because the predicted value of played_hours would be the same as the actual value. The red dashed line on the graph above has the equation y=x and indicates the perfect scenario in which RMSPE = 0. A large majority of the points are located off of the red which shows that gender and experience are weak predictors of played_hours."
