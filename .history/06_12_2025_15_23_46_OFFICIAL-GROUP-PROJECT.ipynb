    "A group of UBC students have created their own special minecraft server. The purpose of the server is to gather data about the players, and how they play the game to gain possible insights on machine learning and AI. The students have provided us with data about the individual players and logged sessions on the server. This data is in the form of two .csv (comma separated values) files - players.csv and sessions.csv. In this project we will highlight a specific question we have formulated about relationships, patterns or correlations between the data to find out specific information on the players and/or sessions. The conclusions of our projects will be provided to the owners of the server and used to assist in their study about AI and machine learning. Our topic of interest within the data sets is about predicting which “kinds” of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data. What this topic really means is which types of players had the most total played hours on the minecraft server. Based on this topic, we have formulated a specific question to determine if there is any sort of correlation between the observations of variables within the dataset and the observations of the total played hours variable. We proposed, \"Can gender, experience level, and age predict played_hours in the players.csv dataset?\", as our predictive question. Throughout the report, we will use a series of data analysis, including visualization and modeling, to help answer our predictive question.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are a total of 196 observations in the players dataset. Each observation represents an individual who has played the minecraft server. The dataset contains seven total variables, four of them being “played_hours”, “Age”, “gender” and “experience”. The following table (Table 1) has been created to summarize the 7 variables. Three more tables (Table 2, 3 and 4) have been created to include the summary statistics of the players.csv dataset. These statistics include the mean, min and max values for different categories within the dataset and within different groups of observations by using the group_by function. One important step is that we must check if there are any N/A values in the observations of the players.csv dataset. This is necessary because if there are any N/A values within the variables of interest then when performing data wrangling, modelling or visualization  could possibly result in an error. The following code reveals that within the \"Age\" column there are 2 N/A's. Therefore, in future code we must make sure to remove these N/A's so we don't receive an error. Our dataset also contains many outliers. Outliers are specific data points that have very extreme values that differ greatly from the majority of other data points. We must take this into consideration.\n"

    "We decided to proceed with a linear regression model to explore the relationship between hours played and the age, gender, and experience level of players. A 70/30 split was utilized for our training and testing data as it is standard for smaller datasets to prefer more training data. The step_novel function was crucial in avoiding any errors if the testing data contained factor levels that didn’t appear in training, and the step_dummy function with argument one_hot = TRUE was used to convert factors to numericals and create columns for each level of these factors. This was done to avoid any potential errors when a rarely occurred factor level, such as when a gender in the “Other” category is not included in training data, and thus the engine doesn’t know how to deal with it when it encounters it in testing. The step_impute_median function was used to handle occurrences of NA valued ages without completely removing the data. Instead, it replaces these values with the median of that variable from the training set. Finally, we used step_normalize and step_zv to normalize each predictor and remove zero-variance predictors.\n"
